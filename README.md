# Mitochondrial-Dynamics

A computational approach for the selection of novel mitochondrial dynamics candidate proteins was designed based on interactions between proteins and possible similarities in regulatory mechanisms.

Two scripts were used within this analysis

 - MD_NetworkSetting was used to create 16 networks for the selection of an optimal number of interaction and confidence score
 - MD_Network_Analysis was used for the eventual analysis.

All additional files needed to run the scripts are present in the folder files.
